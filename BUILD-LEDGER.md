# BUILD LEDGER — the execution tracker (Project Rift)

> **What this is.** The one forward-facing list of *planned-but-not-yet-built* work, so the
> coming code phase doesn't clobber itself. Born 2026-07-09 after ~60 commits of docs-only
> design across ~15 plan docs left the "what still needs code" pile scattered with no unified
> view. **It tracks; it does not design.** Design detail lives in the plan docs; card-level
> status lives in `CARD-CATALOG.md`; decision *history* lives in the MASTER-PLAN Coordination
> Log. This doc sits above them and answers only four questions per item: **what's unbuilt ·
> where it's specced · what code it touches · what it collides with / waits on.**
>
> **Maintain it** (see §4): when a design locks, add/flip a row here in the *same commit*; when
> code merges, flip to 🔨 + SHA. This is a living doc through the planning week — update, don't
> let it rot. It is an INDEX, never a second spec — if you're tempted to write design here,
> write it in the plan doc and link.

**Sibling docs:** `MASTER-PLAN.md` (living state + decision log) · `CARD-CATALOG.md` (per-card
status) · `DECK-LAYOUT.md` (deck anatomy) · plan docs per system (WORLD / TANK / TEMPO /
ALCHEMIST / MENDER / PROGRESSION / GEAR / TEETH / REFIT / SEAL-PILLAR).

## LEGEND

| Glyph | Means | |
|---|---|---|
| 🔒 | **ready** | design locked — buildable now |
| 🟡 | **verdict** | waiting on a Bill decision before build (see §3) |
| 🔴 | **design** | captured only — design itself not finished |
| ⏳ | **owed** | base is built; this piece is the owed follow-up |
| 💡 | **idea** | parking lot — unclaimed, not decided |
| 🔨 | **wip / built** | in progress or merged (record SHA) |

**Playtest ≠ verdict.** Some 🔒 items (tank/flow numbers) are *design-locked, tune-on-feel* —
build them, then dial. That's not a §3 blocker.

---

## 0. READ FIRST — THE COLLISION MAP

The planned work is **not ~70 independent tasks.** It piles onto a handful of core files. Build
blind and two claims fight over the same reducer. These are the hotspots, ranked by centrality ×
incoming load.

### Core-file hotspots

| File (lines) | What's landing on it | Sequencing rule |
|---|---|---|
| `core/combat_core.gd` (1148) | FLOW=AGGRO rewire (threat, 44 refs) · dodge-unify finish (`:83-114`) · interrupt-by-ability flag · `perform()` input surface | **#1.** Aggro + dodge + interrupt all edit the reducer. Serialize. Aggro is a *deliberate* checksum rebaseline. |
| `game/raid_hud.gd` (4496) | Every class gauge · aggro box · tank/dodge/drop UI · **Art V2 C6A dashboard host/layout routing** · queued Meter L4/L5 | C6A stays additive and `ArtV2.dash`-guarded; default-off builds the whole legacy HUD. Merge current `main` before the slice and do not mix Seal/Meter work into it. |
| `game/stage2d/raid_stage_2d.gd` + `game/art_v2/scene_kit.gd` | **C6A theater-safe rectangle:** stage keeps local slot grammar while dash mode moves the shared actor/floor composition into the upper theater | One view-only contract owns both. Legacy/default-off floor and feet remain unchanged; do not independently nudge actor slots and scene floor. |
| `data/raid/raid_content.gd` (626) | Seal beat data · `threat_enabled` (`:625`) · melee/telegraph split (`:8`) · **THE SEAL REWORK (`BOSS-PLAN.md` S2–S5 — supersedes Seal-pillar)** · aura-add · Trial-Ladder Versions | The whole boss wave edits this. Serialize claims; each shifts fight checksums **on purpose**. ⚠ `wow-descent-map` owns it live — SEAL REWORK content lands only after that merge. |
| `game/draft.gd` (+ `draft_sim`) | Rarity tier-roll engine · rerolls-out/REGENERATE · loot two-modes · curse cards→JAILBREAK deals · spells reweight · curio-pool v2 · EASE dial knob-roll · Market stock + shared bank (§I) | One draft/roll pipeline. Serialize claims; keep `draft_sim` green each merge. |
| **map layer**: `game/run_map.gd` · `game/map_content.gd` · `game/campaign_core.gd` · `sim/raid_map_sim.gd` | **THE DESCENT REBUILD (§I)**: 4-floor inputs · new node kinds (MARKET/JAILBREAK/CAPTCHA/BENCHMARK/SERVER ROOM/PATCH BAY/WILD) · GATE retirement · ticket shapes/re-price · seed-from-run-seed | **ONE deliberate re-baseline bang** (§I header). Land AFTER `purge-oldgame`. New kinds touch `to_dict`/`from_dict`/fingerprint/server-broadcast together; walker + `CampaignCore.ticket_at` move together (divergence trap). |
| `net/net_server.gd` (798) · `net/raid_net.gd` (220) | Online `(seed,spec)` spec-carry · Depth `spec.depth` · §4 MMO extraction | Versioned protocol — rebuild+redeploy coupled. **Class registry (P4) gates spec-carry of arbitrary builds.** |
| world save `rift_world.cfg` + Atlas screens | Unlock Tree · TICKETS v2 · Zone-Remembers · W3 front-door · W4 write-back | Interlocked — all serialize state onto one save + one Atlas UI. **Unlock System is the spine.** |
| `core/boss_state.gd` (61) · `core/combat_state.gd` (73) · `data/tuning_config.gd` (70) | Threat state + master flags (`threat_enabled`, tuning) | The tank/aggro rework edits all three together. |
| `core/class_kit.gd` (101) · `data/class_codex.gd` (402) | New kit hooks per reworked class · per-class doc strings (stale "SPACE/F") | Every class rework touches both. |
| `data/bulwark/bulwark_kit.gd` (473) | Old `Challenge` taunt (aggro) **+** two-verb dodge **+** being replaced by the new tank | **Highest per-file collision — but moot: retire it with the tank wave, don't invest.** |

### The deliberate-rebaseline cluster ⚠

These intentionally **change fight checksums** (byte-identical A/B does NOT apply — they alter
behavior on purpose). Sequence them so the sim baseline resets **as few times as possible**,
and re-pin `ab-gate.sh` baselines right after each:

- Generic boss-vulnerability stack (REFIT-P4) — then TEAM-COMP + Depth + Well-glint ride it (one reset, not three).
- FLOW=AGGRO rewire (tank wave) — **now also deletes the taunt button outright (`BOSS-PLAN §1`, 2026-07-10)**.
- ~~Seal Pillar Pass v1 (dodge-ration nudge)~~ → **THE SEAL REWORK (`BOSS-PLAN.md` §8, 2026-07-10)** — one bang per Seal slice S2–S5, untouched Seals byte-identical per slice; S0 instrumentation is byte-identical.
- **THE DESCENT REBUILD map bang (§I)** — floors/quotas/kinds/seeding in ONE `raid_map_sim` re-baseline (post-purge).

### Stale / superseded code to RETIRE (not just add-around)

| Old code | Where | Replaced by |
|---|---|---|
| Threat / aggro / taunt system | `threat_enabled` gate (`combat_state.gd:43`, default off) → `combat_core` (44) · `boss_state.gd:57-61` · `tuning_config.gd:56` · `bulwark_kit` Challenge · `raid_hud` T-CHALLENGE (25) · `raid_sim` (17) | **FLOW=AGGRO** (tank wave) — largest single collision surface. **⚠ 07-10: taunt = FULL DELETE (no repurpose — `CombatCore.taunt()`/`taunt_seat_i` die; aggro 100% passive, `BOSS-PLAN §1`); `BossState.threat`/`_threat_target()` survive re-sourced; THREAT_DROP re-bases as FLOW DUMP.** |
| Two-verb dodge (SPACE+F) | `combat_core.gd:83-114` elif · stale "SPACE/F" in `class_codex` + `raid_hud:2414` hint | **dodge-unify** — done for twinfang/alch/well; owed for bulwark*/mender/bloomweaver/reckoner/voidcaller, per rework |
| Voidcaller (full class, wired) | `data/voidcaller/*` + `raid_hud` (15) + run_state/draft/gauge | ~~frozen until interrupt-by-ability~~ → **DELETED NOW (THE PURGE 2026-07-10, §A½)** — Mender + Reckoner + solo bosses/gates go with it |
| `verdance_gauge.gd:19-20` DEPRECATED compat vars | Bloomweaver gauge | Dead surface — delete on next Bloomweaver touch |

\* Bulwark's dodge migration is **moot** — the whole kit is being replaced by the new tank.

### Doc-drift to reconcile (found during this audit)

- **MASTER §SYSTEMS-E (line ~670):** calls GEAR-2 "the open follow-up" — but GEAR-2 **merged** (`gear2`). Real open = **GEAR-3 (Market)**.
- **MASTER OVERALL PROGRESS (line ~27):** lists the pre-rework roster as "✅ playable + verified" — stale framing in the rework era.
- **MASTER §GRAPHICS:** "Wire the other 4 HUDs to CombatStage3D" — **dead** (4 solo HUDs + `stage3d/` deleted in REFIT P1).
- **Twinfang "Through-Line":** merge banner (`67f5efc`) says built; card annotations (TEMPO A1/A6) say "design owed." **Treat as unbuilt** until reconciled.
- **Well "Reservoir rework" (MENDER §8.4):** listed open, but deck banner shows it built (re-homed SPILL→SURGE). Stale open item.
- **Well DECK:** **built in code** (`well-deck`, `500334f`) — but `CARD-CATALOG` shows it "not authored," meaning *not back-filled into the catalog format*, **not** un-built. Clarify in CARD-CATALOG.

## 1. THE DEPENDENCY SPINE (what unblocks what)

Not a mandate — Bill picks slices (thinnest-flagged-first, feel-verdict before breadth). This is
the **prerequisite logic** so any slice you pick, you know what must land under it.

**Wave 0 — RAILS FIRST (de-risk the whole content wave; mostly REFIT-P4).** These are the
build-once seams that five separate class reworks and the endgame all need:
- Generic boss-vulnerability stack · Class registry (`class_id→factory`) · Save unification (one Profile incl. roster) + reproducible offline `run_seed` · ClassBand registry + shared Gauge base · Rarity tier-roll engine (`draft.gd`) · Topology elite-node type (keystones) · Online `(seed,spec)` spec-carry.

**Wave 1 — TANK + AGGRO** (co-dependent — flow has no driver without the tank minigame; aggro rewires the tank's threat source): FLOW=AGGRO + Duelist base kit together → sims + HUD → Duelist deck (after §3 verdict) → Warden → per-Seal streams + tank interrupt flag. *Retire old taunt + Bulwark here.*

**Wave 2 — CLASS RESHAPE (Phase 2)** — cheap once Wave 0 exists: signature CD per class · 3-axis filing · branches · owed HUD gauges (on the shared base) · buff-channel application · dodge migration per class · interrupt-by-ability class-by-class (Tempo first). Finish Cask 2–5, Twinfang owed + 2nd spec, Fermata recode, Well gauges/AI/balance; back-fill CARD-CATALOG as you go. **⚠ 07-10: the ABILITY-LAW allowance tightened +2→+1 (ceiling 6, DECK-LAYOUT §5) — every reshape's button math re-runs; Alchemist's catalyst + 3 spells now compete for ONE slot; freshness beyond it = ABILITY TRANSFORMS (Tempo pilots, TEMPO §17.11).**

**Wave 3 — WORLD / META** (`rift_world.cfg` + Atlas): Unlock System (spine) → W3 doors + front-door flip → GEAR-3 Market (the token sink) → rerolls-out → TICKETS v2 / Zone-Remembers / Risk Fork / Quest Board / RESTED / curio-pool v2 / actives socket → W4 living world.

**Wave 4 — DEPTH & TEETH** (`draft.gd` + map + Depth): CONTEST · loot two-modes · curse cards · spells pilot · event-crafting → Trial Ladder (proves scaling hooks) → RAID DEPTH (rides Trial Ladder + vuln stack) → Endless (a *door* on Depth, don't fork).

**Wave 5 — BOSSES & ENDGAME:** **THE SEAL REWORK (`BOSS-PLAN.md` — supersedes Seal Pillar Pass v1; S0 sim-side now, content S2–S5 after descent-map + Wave-1)** · aura-add second-cast-source (still parked — BOSS-PLAN v1 needs no 2nd telegraph source) · TEAM-COMP schools (rides vuln stack). *Boss-redo era for the 15 solo bosses is on HOLD — don't redesign now.*

**Wave 6 — MMO SHELL:** Gateway / InstanceHost / CampaignEngine — only after P4 rails.

**Cross-cutting, land anytime:** Kill-Switch P3 · MAP-2 depth · code-audit findings · tooling loose ends · graphics re-rig.

## 2. THE SLATE — by workstream

### A. Combat-engine cross-cutting (the shared seams)

| Item | St | Specced | Touches | Blocks on / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Generic boss-vulnerability stack | 🔨 `855ac2f` | REFIT-P4 | `CombatCore.add_vuln/vuln_mult` · `boss_state.vulns` · Well glint migrated · dead boss-level expose retired | BUILT — rebaseline landed (twinfang/alch ab-gates byte-identical; well/raid shifted on purpose). TEAM-COMP + Depth fold slots ready; `vuln_probe` guards. |
| TEAM-COMP damage-schools | 🔒 | MASTER §OPEN-IDEAS | `damage_boss` amp, `ClassKit.school_of`, `EncounterRes` profiles, HUD pops | Rides vuln stack. Parked behind Commander per Bill. Byte-identical when profile empty. |
| Interrupt-by-ability pillar | 🔨 **PARTIAL — MERGED `3126437`** (2026-07-12; class-side flag + press + castbar) · boss-side slice still 🔒 | WORLD §PILLARS #3 **+ `BOSS-PLAN §1½` (the kick contract, 07-10)** | ~~`ClassKit.ability_interrupts(id)` flag + `combat_core._try_interrupt`/`stagger_boss(by_seat)` + `raid_hud kickable_seat←carries_kick`~~ 🔨 · `AbilityRes.kick_window` tight-slice + verse-table sim diag (boss-side, BOSS-PLAN E8) still 🔒 | **BUILT: press your ability ANY time during an INTERRUPTIBLE cast to stop it. Carriers = Twinfang `eviscerate` + Duelist `dump` (the two combo finishers).** **SIMPLIFIED by Bill 2026-07-12: NO tight window, NO whiff, NO interrupt tax** (the 07-10 "small absolute slice / missed-kick-costliest" amendment is DEFERRED to the boss-side S7 pass — the press-anytime feel ships first). Open Q **RESOLVED: Evis carries** (Coup-premium not built). Guarded/byte-identical for non-carriers (ab-gate alchemist_sim PASS). **OWED:** AI deliberate-kicker policy · Alchemist dump = 3rd kicker · S7 `kick_window` tighten + verse-table diag · legacy Twinfang `_kick` button coexists (Bill may cut). |
| Aura-add / 2nd cast source | 🔴 | MASTER §BOSSES | engine 2nd telegraph source | Blocks R3 raid content; also eases the one-telegraph interrupt problem. |

### A½. THE OLD-GAME PURGE (2026-07-10 — Bill; MASTER §GAME SHAPE amendment)

| Item | St | Specced | Touches | Blocks on / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **THE PURGE** — delete Voidcaller · Mender · Reckoner + the 15 solo bosses + the GATE node kind; defaults flip caster→Alchemist(brew) · healer→Well(brim) | 🔨 **MERGED `0582294`** (2026-07-10; protocol v13; full verify surface green; bands re-baselined — WORLD-PLAN §Length-bands) | MASTER §GAME SHAPE 07-10 amendment | `data/{voidcaller,mender,reckoner}/*` · `data/raid/gate_content.gd` · `run_map`/`map_content`/`map_screen`/`raid_hud` gate flow · `class_codex` · `raid_content` seat factories+defaults · `net_server`/`raid_net` (protocol bump) · policies/binds/gauges/rigs · `draft`/`armor_slots` · sims (`raid_sim` defaults · `raid_map_sim` re-baseline · `raid_healer_probe`/`raid_reckoner_probe`) · `verify-all.sh` | **Deliberate re-baseline** (maps regen w/o gates; comp flips; **NO-KICKER interim** until pillar #3). Keeps Twinfang Warden/Executioner as `twinfang_sim` training dummies only. ⚠ Collides with live `cask-policy` + `tempo-pilot` worktrees — merge main often. |
| **Bulwark deletion** (the last fossil) | 🔨 `62cc09e` | MASTER §GAME SHAPE 07-10 | `data/bulwark/*` · `raid_tank_policy` · `raid_hud` tank band · the old threat/taunt surface | **Dies in the SAME merge that ships the Duelist base kit (Wave 1) — never before**: it is the only tank in code. Supersedes "retire with the tank wave" phrasing in §0 (now a hard rule). |
| Gate-sourced + dead-class GEAR rows re-home/cut | ⏳ | GEAR-CATALOG banner 07-10 | `game/gear.gd` tables · `gear_probe` | Per class-rework deck (CARD-TRACKING LAW). `gear_probe` re-scopes at the purge merge. |

### B. Tank rework + FLOW=AGGRO (Wave 1 — co-dependent) · ⚒ build brief: `DUELIST-BRIEF.md` (2026-07-10 — slices S0–S8; S0–S4 verdict-free, S5–S7 gate on Bill's §3 board + §10.6)

**⚠ 2026-07-11 — THE TANK-V2 REWRITE (Bill: the tank-w1 build broke the game — full rewrite, no
patching).** Design of record = **TANK-PLAN §0 THE CHANNEL CONTRACT v3**. The 🔨 `62cc09e` rows below
are the implementation being REPLACED (design intent mostly survives; §0 wins diffs). New rows:

| Item | St | Specced | Touches | Blocks on / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TANK-V2 · engine+kit bang (committed timeline + rewritten kit)** | 🔨 `5af4927` | **TANK §0** | `core/boss_state.gd` (rhythm_*→stream timeline) · `core/combat_core.gd` (two-writer publish, barrier, flurry mode, pack shatter) · new `data/duelist/*` (v3 matrix, tick-native grading, bullseye ladder) · `data/tuning_config.gd` (stream knobs + `dodge_recovery` raise) · `net_protocol` v17 | BUILT (S1 `30008b6`). Deliberate checksum rebaseline; non-rhythm encounters byte-identical by construction. `stream_probe` = the law suite, ALL OK. **Bill's playtest = the feel gate.** |
| **TANK-V2 · THE CHANNEL (global answer widget) + band + STREAM TUNER** | 🔨 `5af4927` | TANK §0 | NEW `game/ui/answer_channel.gd` (class-agnostic) + new `duelist_band.gd` + `stream_tuner.gd` (F9, dev) · strike_judge/cast_dial RESTORED pre-tank · `raid_hud.gd` seams · old duelist widgets + Bulwark fossils deleted | BUILT. The channel is the game's ONE answer instrument (tank first, classes migrate later). ⚠ WSLg screenshot pass owed. |
| **BARRAGE RETIREMENT + dodge-cd raise (cross-class)** | 🔨 `5af4927` | TANK §0 + DODGE-PLAN amendment | `_barrage`/`_tank_string` builders collapse beats to ONE · `dodge_recovery` 0.35→0.8 (playtest knob) | BUILT. Other classes' training-content strings untouched (swept at their channel migration). ⚠ Seal thread: hold §3-texture/string authoring; Seal stream density = an S6/SealTune knob (the barrier is law). |
| TANK-V2 · deck re-land (post-playtest) | ⏳ | TANK §3/§9/§10 boards | kit-local card layers on the NEW kit | tank-v2 ships DECKLESS; Bill's base playtest verdict gates this. Catalog stays 🟡 (62cc09e defaults die un-verdicted). |
| TANK-V2 · per-Seal texture profiles + busters + LATE authoring | ⏳ | TANK §0 (S6) + BOSS-PLAN §3 | per-body profile dicts in Seal/forge content | After swap merge; Seal rework consumes. |

**⚠ 2026-07-12 — THE TANK-V3 REBUILD (attempt 3; Bill: tank-v2 was still fully buggy in play + broke the
other three classes).** Design of record = **TANK-PLAN §0 THE CHANNEL CONTRACT v3 (FINAL BUILD SPEC)** —
Design C's two-surface skeleton (channel = committed melee; judge/cast bar = raid globals+casts), full
A/B unification REJECTED (DEC-1). Built on branch **tank-v3**, slices S1 `717b2a2` → S5 (this commit).
All raid combat changes ride **one** protocol version, **v18** (no per-slice bumps).

| Item | St | Specced | Touches | Blocks on / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TANK-V3 · S1 law-suite probe + byte-free UI fixes** | 🔨 `717b2a2` | TANK §0 §2 §7.4-5 §11 | `sim/stream_probe.gd` (v3 invariants) · `answer_channel.gd` (octagon projection + `_tempo_vis` DELETED → constant pps) · `duelist_band.gd` (octagon feed deleted, judge un-hidden) · `raid_hud.gd` (`_seat_judge_window`, feed-or-deactivate UNCONDITIONAL — R5 frozen-ghost fixed at source for ALL seats) | **Byte-free** (UI only; NO protocol bump). Kills the pop/flicker + the blade/caster/healer frozen ghost. |
| **TANK-V3 · S2 continuity — retire the barrier** | 🔨 `e99d2ae` | TANK §0 §2, DEC-2 | `core/combat_core.gd` (`_stream_barrier` DELETED; `_stream_publish` unconditional to horizon; `stream_breathe` added, default off; debug immutability assert) · `boss_state.gd` (debug snap) · `tuning_config.gd` (gap/clear knobs RETIRED) · `net_protocol` **v17→v18** · `stream_probe` continuity flipped HARD | **Deliberate NON-byte-identical rebaseline** (the barrier WAS the #1 hitch). Kills the "second between generations". |
| **TANK-V3 · S3 cross-class restoration — THE merge-back gate** | 🔨 `bdd72a7` | TANK §0 §7.1-3, DEC-4/5 | `tuning_config.gd` (`dodge_recovery` 0.8→**0.35** revert) · `raid_content.gd` (BARRAGE un-collapse: one StrikeRes/beat = PILLAR #2 ration · rhythm melee added to **Mistral+Gemini**) · `raid_sim.gd` (ration instrumentation) | **Deliberate re-baseline** (§7 items 1-3 — the regression v17 shipped as a footnote). `_doom` stays a single BRACE beat (DEC-10). Fixes the gemini-0%/mistral-27% expert regression. |
| **TANK-V3 · S4 vocabulary/legality/LATE/immutability polish** | 🔨 `dfa1d38` | TANK §0 §4 §5, DEC-11/14/15 | `combat_core.gd` (LATE min-travel floor + per-fight cap; obs floor) · `boss_state.gd` (`stream_late_count`) · `tuning_config.gd` (`stream_late_min_travel`/`stream_late_cap`/`answer_claim`) · `duelist_config.gd`+`duelist_kit.gd` (`_press_claims` tie-break, `_answer_legal` matrix, landed-parry mit **.95 restored** — was silently clamped to .90) | On-top-of-v18 combat (no further bump). |
| **TANK-V3 · S5 net + final verification (merge-back bar)** | 🔨 (this commit) | TANK §0 §8 (req 33), §7 gate | `sim/stream_probe.gd` (forced-multi-step process-order probe — real controller catch-up drain, single coherent comet slide, no jump) · `raid_hud.gd` (BUILD_STAMP → TANK-V3 v18) · `net_protocol` v18 note (whole rebaseline) · docs | **`server/preflight.sh` OK · net_smoke/net_map_smoke checksum-identical over loopback (v18) · WSLg render confirmed (tank + Alchemist, no octagon/no frozen ghost, casts on cast bar) · `verify-all` SEEDS=300 green (all four classes in one merge).** §7 items 1-3 are the deliberate non-byte-identical re-baseline — do NOT chase the checksum diff. Per-Seal human-eye tour = Bill's playtest gate. |
| FLOW=AGGRO universal rewire | 🔨 `62cc09e` | TANK §1c/1d | built threat engine (source damage→flow), seeded peel roll, `raid_content.gd:8` | Numbers→playtest. Revises "aggro=raid-only" (`b2afbca`) → universal. Rips out `threat_enabled` system. |
| **THE ANSWER-SHAPE LAW — shape=answer · color=status · size=damage** | 🔨 **MERGED `01f14fd`** (feat `666fba4`); grading follow-up `bf887cd`; visual follow-up specified | Bill 2026-07-13 · GRAPHICS-PLAN §2.3.1 | `game/ui/answer_channel.gd` (shape match: heavy→octagon, global→hexagon, beat=neutral diamond; color=status; size scale) · `bands/duelist_band.gd` · `data/duelist/duelist_kit.gd` · `duelist_config.gd` · `policies/duelist_policy.gd` | **◇ dodge-or-parry · ⬡ dodge-only · ⯃ parry-only · ⊘ BRACE/no-action.** RED=peeled, blue=flurry, purple alone=feint; feints cover all three pressable shapes, never BRACE. PARRY now lands on visible GREAT/PERFECT (`bf887cd`). Runtime still uses its first-pass skull/X and owes the barred-disc/BRACE visual follow-up in C6B or a thin UI patch; combat legality is unchanged. |
| Duelist guarded base kit | 🔨 `62cc09e` | TANK §4 + **brief S1** | new `data/duelist/*`, bespoke PARRY+DODGE (no `unified_dodge`/ration) | Numbers→playtest. **Verdict-free (base carries no cards — brief §0; the board gate moved to the deck slices S5–S7).** A/B on-branch; Bulwark dies at the same merge (§A½). |
| Peel mechanics (progressive + grace-delay) | 🔨 `62cc09e` | TANK §1c **+ BOSS-PLAN §1** | aggro-% shape, victim dodge bar, ~~TAUNT hard-override~~ **NO TAUNT (07-10)** — valve = perfect-MAIN flow spike + THE GAZE boon lane | Part of FLOW=AGGRO. Grace-delay = the VICTIM'S window only (det-safe fixed tick offset). |
| Tank defensive signature CD ("the wall") | 🔨 `62cc09e` | TANK §1b, **§10.2 (designed 2026-07-10)**, DECK-LAYOUT §5 | new ~1-min CD, carries dropped GUARD | **Duelist's is DESIGNED: ⏱ EN GARDE** (invite +25% melee tempo · leaks halved · double flow · perfect-MAIN ◆◆ · 2 slips break it; amplifier never override — the post-taunt clutch question at Bill). Warden keeps THE GATE (§8.6). |
| Duelist deck v1 **+ v2 revision (D2, 2026-07-10)** | 🔨 `62cc09e` | TANK §3 + **§9**, CARD-CATALOG | kit-local layers, `_fw()` dispatch (Well idiom) | **Whole slate at Bill's board** — §9 adds the v1.1 reconcile (EASE fold executed · FLOW = 4th Floor-1 candidate · Hold-the-Line→FLOW re-key) + 3 challenger SWAP KITS pre-authored (any pick = ready deck). GUARD trio resolved → Warden §8. Estocada/Reckoning-Stroke freeze-beat rhyme at Bill. |
| **Duelist — ABILITY PASS (3 transforms + doors, TEMPO-§17.11 treatment)** | 🔨 `62cc09e` | **TANK §10** (2026-07-10) + CARD-CATALOG | kit-local — same touch set as the deck (transform layer on the kit reducer; seize hold-state + flèche load timer; Floor-2 ceremony offer) | **PRISE DE FER** (parry seize/throw) · **REMISE** (prime/commit two-press) · **FLÈCHE** (dump loads onto next perfect answer), each a DOOR w/ 2 sub-boons + 1 rig WHEN; +1 slot EMPTY (4 of 6 targets). Dancer runs exclude the parry transforms from the offer. **Acquisition pattern LOCKED by the Tempo GO 07-10 (Floor-2 1-of-3 ceremony)** — cards still 🟡 (§10.6). Brief S7. |
| FLOW module (aggro→damage upgrade) | 🔨 `62cc09e` | TANK §1b | new STRAT module | Competes for Floor-1 module slot. Reconcile at deck reshape. |
| Duelist sims + carry | 🔨 `62cc09e` | TANK §4.4 | new `duelist_sim`, `raid_sim --tank=` | After base + deck. |
| Duelist HUD slice | 🔨 `62cc09e` | TANK §4.5 | `raid_hud` timing instrument, own FLOW bar, shared aggro box | WSLg screenshot (headless can't `_draw`). Non-tanks get no flow bar. |
| Warden spec (base + deck) | 🟡 | TANK §5 + **§8 DECK v1 (D1, 2026-07-10)** | new — BLOCK/SHIELD/SHIELD-SLAM, no dodge | Base locked; **deck NOW AUTHORED 🟡** (Payload·Slam·Rampart; 🔮 guard trio re-homed; MONOLITH wild creed; THE GATE CD shape). Build still waits for the Duelist frame (Wave-1 order). CARD-CATALOG rows landed. |
| **Warden — BRANCH SLATE (5 themes)** | 🟡 | TANK §6 + `research/warden-sweep.md` | design only (deck pass = Phase-2 row D1) | Payload · Slam · Rampart · Bannerman · Thornback — Bill picks 2–3. Absorbs the 🔮 guard trio + carries (filing table). Bannerman flags the buff-channel debt. |
| **Duelist — CHALLENGER SLATE (3 vs the v1 ladders)** | 🟡 | TANK §7 + `research/duelist-sweep.md` | design only (deck revision = Phase-2 row D2) | Matador · Stormweave · Scarlet Trade join the SAME §3 verdict board as deck v1 (incumbents = PITCH #0a/b/c); Bill picks 2–3 ladders total. 1 kill (Planted Blade — collision), ~8 fixes. |
| Tank per-Seal streams + interrupt flag + spec-carry | ⏳ | TANK §4.6 | encounter data per Seal | Ship with build, not deck. Interrupt flag with the pillar-#3 pass. |
| **Bloomweaver — CLASS SLATE (4 core candidates)** | 🟡 | `BLOOM-PLAN.md` (NEW) + `research/bloom-sweep.md` | design only — winning core later builds as a guarded class (Well pattern) + deck (Phase-2 row D3) | Orchard Clock · Trellis · Briar · Pruning, 2 spec seeds each; Bill picks ONE core. Do-not-merge (07-06) honored; Trellis HUD lift + Pruning rule-4 death-clause flagged. |
| **Bloomweaver — ORCHARD CLOCK DECK v0 (D3)** | 🟡 | BLOOM §4 + CARD-CATALOG section | design only — PROVISIONAL on core A (core pick B/C/D = free re-run); build waits on core pick + feel tester | 4 creeds (WILD ROWS) · Almanac (⚠ the roster's first forward-timeline gauge — HUD cost flagged) · Cider Press · 11 boons · Full Bloom/Orchard Eternal keystones · THE SEASON CD · Harvest Home support. Orchard-Eternal ends on WILT (hits-taken pricing avoided). |

### C. Class reshape (Phase 2) + shared class substrate

**Shared substrate — build ONCE, unblocks many classes:**

| Item | St | Specced | Touches | Blocks on / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rarity tier-roll engine (H/S/O + runes) | 🔒 | TEMPO App-A, ALCH v3, CASK §7.4, FERMATA §7 | `game/draft.gd`, per-class boons, runes | **DESIGNED-NOT-BUILT.** Blocks real rarity for Tempo/Fermata/Brew/Cask/Well *simultaneously*. |
| Topology elite-node type (keystone acquisition) | 🔨 **OFFLINE `1e66130`** | TEMPO A8, FERMATA §13.6, CASK §7.6 + **DESCENT §5** | `game/draft.gd` · `raid_hud` (elite win path) · `draft_screen` | **BUILT 2026-07-12 (Bill):** keystones FILTERED out of the normal draft (`Draft.is_keystone`/`offerable`), granted only via a **1-of-2 elite offer** (`roll_keystone_offer`), **capped 1/run/seat** (`has_keystone`). Wired at the ELITE win (per-seat chain, human+AI, before the reforge). Twinfang FERMATA keystones now reachable too. **ONLINE offer still ⏳** (protocol wiring, like the curse system — online normal drafts already exclude keystones via shared `Draft`). |
| raid_hud gauge/meter render pass | ⏳ | TEMPO/FERMATA/MENDER/CASK | `raid_hud` + per-class gauges | Do it on the **shared Gauge base** (P4). WSLg render. |
| Online `(seed,spec)` spec-carry | ⏳ | TEMPO §13.7, ALCH §6, MENDER | `raid_net.gd` | One debt for all reworked classes. Class registry (P4) precondition for arbitrary builds. |
| Raid buff-channel application | ⏳ | TEMPO App-A, FERMATA §7 | raid buff channel | Battle Hymn + Veil Warband + Cask "Round for the House". Debilitator/Shining Hour = precedent. |
| DECK-LAYOUT Phase 2 program | 🔒 | DECK-LAYOUT §7 | every `data/<class>/*.gd` + CARD-CATALOG | Program locked; per-class feel-verdicts open (CD shape, 2-vs-3 branches, keystone generic-vs-category). **2026-07-09: modules = add-ons, transformer requirement DROPPED (no ⭐-transformer owed per class); reshape deepens pools via sub-specs/branches, not flat boons (EASE dial handles de-bloat). ABILITY LAW locked (§5): 7-touch-target ceiling (Well 8) — see the compliance-trim row below.** |
| ABILITY-LAW compliance trims (Alch bar · Well book) | 🔒 | DECK-LAYOUT §5 | `alchemist_boons.gd` `SPELL_CAP`/bar · `well_boons.gd` book+cap · mobile layouts | At each class's reshape, not before. Fully-drafted Brew = 9 targets w/ CD (catalyst button + 3 spells compete for the 2 allowance slots); Well loaded = 10 vs its 8 — **now 11 with SKIN (MENDER §13, 2026-07-10); trim explicitly PARKED per Bill ("don't worry bout 8 cap"), stays this row's job**. Retune per-class `SPELL_CAP` to what the ceiling leaves free. |
| Signature CD per class (baseline) | 🔒 | DECK-LAYOUT §5 | new baseline button per class | Schema locked; per-class shapes open. Amplify skill, never button=damage. |
| EASE difficulty-dial (rolled comfort↔bite knob) | 🔒 | DECK-LAYOUT §4 | `draft.gd` knob-roll · per-class minigame knobs (window/speed/grace) · `raid_hud` dial card-face | Replaces flat comfort boons pool-wide (built per-class at reshape). **Rides the rarity tier-roll engine** (bite +dmg is rarity-scaled). **Same knobs Depth/Seal-pillar compress from the boss side — coordinate the caps** (two writers). Tank folds Quick Wrists/Roll With It in. |
| CARD-CATALOG back-fill (stub classes) | ⏳ | CARD-CATALOG | doc only | Tank fully populated; Twinfang/Alchemist/Well/Mender/frozen = stubs. `dump-cards.sh` deferred. |

**Per-class reshape work:**

Bill picks 2–3 → deck pass files old+new cards into the winners. The six rewire pitches → TEMPO §15 parking 🔮 (future spec/aspect ideas; Coup-as-interrupt + CD-shape notes stay live inputs to §3 verdicts). |

| Twinfang — 2nd rhythm-variant spec (FERMATA) | 🔨 `f5d5397` | TEMPO §13, FERMATA-BRIEF | fermata kit + slate | Built & merged (verb + deck v5). Stale "design owed" corrected 2026-07-09; residual wiring on the row below. |
| Twinfang — Creed/Module wire TODO + killingEdge rig | 🔒 | `twinfang_content.gd:163` | twinfang kit | Only real actionable code TODO in repo. |
| Fermata v5 — owed wiring (HUD meters · elite acq · spec-carry) | ⏳ | FERMATA-BRIEF | shared passes (gauges/elite/`raid_net`) | Verb + slate BUILT (`f5d5397`, grades by depth — stale "recode owed" corrected 2026-07-09); what remains rides the shared substrate rows above. |
| **Fermata — CHALLENGER SLATE (filing + 2 additive themes)** | 🟡 | TEMPO §16 + `research/fermata-sweep.md` | design only (deck revision = Phase-2 row D8) | v5 ladders named (Brinkman · Rested Blade · Window-Setter); additive: Afterimage (echo — coded Twin Echo/Phantom anchors) · Cold Hand (Good-band CP + branded Evis — the Brinkman polarity). 3 kills (all law-violations — no v5-cut resurrections), ~5 fixes. **PHASE 1 OF THE SLATE MACHINE DRAINED.** |
| Alchemist — Cask slices 2–5 | 🔒 | ALCH §7.7 | `AlchemistPolicy` + HUD + `data/alchemist` + `alchemist_sim` | Slice 1 built. Slate verdicted 24/6. Tune `cask_base`→Seal parity. |
| **Cask — BRANCH SLATE (filing + 3 additive themes)** | 🟡 | ALCH §9 + `research/cask-sweep.md` | design only (deck pass = Phase-2 row D4) | Locked pool filed (Blend Line · Gauntlet · Tap List); additive: Twin Casks (homes parked Double Barrel) · House Recipe · Taproom (buff-channel debt). §7 verdicts NOT re-opened. Storm Brewer killed pending F3. |
| **Cask — DECK ASSEMBLY (D4)** | ✅/🟡 | ALCH §11 + CARD-CATALOG Cask section | design only — slices 3–5 (§7.7) now have the complete card list | Locked slate hard-copied to catalog at ✅ (24 cards — back-fill drift closed); kits T/H/R at 🟡 (CLOSING TIME renamed — Brew Last-Call collision); EASE knobs listed; Solera×Recipe tune flag. |

| Alchemist — open design calls F1/F2/F3/F20 | 🟡 | ALCH §OPEN | design; F3 would touch dodge/ClassKit | F3 (auto-evasion) gates Cask under-fire risk. |
| Well — module gauges + AI spell-policy | ⏳ | MENDER | `well_gauge.gd`, `well_policy.gd` | Deck built; **AI casts SKIN + pilots the Vigil hold + Second Hand (`ed358aa`/`270b420`)**. **HUD desync sweep DONE (`b9a43d9`):** Eddy window now tracks the graded drift · banked-heal 'BANKED/tap-to-release' affordance + gutter/tremble · SKIN film on ally frames · flume/frozen/glassriver/intercept/eddyline cues · Millrace pip · haste-label · KEY_E skin. **_draw pixels need a WSLg screenshot pass (Bill).** Still owed: AI Meditate/Boiling Over (⚠ pre-existing `boil` book-key vs `boilingOver` boon-id mismatch). |

### D. Overworld / progression / meta (`rift_world.cfg` + Atlas)

| Item | St | Specced | Touches | Blocks on / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| THE SETTING — world fiction + NAMING pass | 🟡 | THEME-PLAN §1–4 | display strings only: rarity labels (`draft.gd` display layer), door-dial name, tooltip nouns, armory renames, Bastion/ticket flavor | Riff v0 at Bill's 7-dial board (THEME §6). Rename via display fields NEVER ids — sims byte-identical (MASTER §REALMS bar). Reverses the global haiku/sonnet/opus wink → Realm-1-local. Fiction dressing rides W2 quest board. |
| THE UNLOCK SYSTEM (tree + one XP meter) | 🔒 | PROGRESSION §UNLOCK | world save, tree UI, per-surface stacks, crest gates | **The meta spine.** Supersedes §LEVELS. Big interlocked build (W2/W3). |
| W3 — doors + front-door flip (PLAY→ATLAS) | 🔒 | WORLD §PHASES | Dungeon 1, Versions dial, raid door, route attunement | Amends GAME SHAPE. Removes old realm-card flow. |
| W4 — living world (online) | 🔒 | WORLD §PHASES | co-op traversal, presence rooms, world-event scheduler, Vorathek world boss | Additive protocol (combat frames untouched). Mid-fight join stays parked. |
| W5 — breadth + retune | 🔒 | WORLD §PHASES | Zone 2 + Dungeon 2, interrupt retune, dodge-ration audit | Later phase. |
| TICKETS v2 (ROUTE/DEED/DOOR/EVENT) | 🔒 | WORLD §QUESTS | world save; reuse ESCORT tech + oath detectors | ESCORT built. EVENT needs W4. Rewards = access/pool/standing, never stats. |
| ELITE nodes = mutator fights | 🔒 | WORLD §ELITE | Forge affix knobs, `forge_sim` | Modifier on enemy side (bare-kit law). |
| THE ZONE REMEMBERS (full flags) | ⏳ | WORLD §ZONE-REMEMBERS | permanent flags on world save | Teaser shipped (W1). Fight-flags enter as `(seed,spec)`. Guest rule needs W4 write-back. |
| Quest Board station (Bastion) | 🔒 | WORLD §MEWGENICS ② | Bastion station | W2. Needs TICKETS v2 grammar. |
| THE RISK FORK | 🔒 | WORLD §MEWGENICS ③ | authored node beat | W2. Needs ELITE mutators. |
| RESTED (real-time XP mult) | 🔒 | TEETH §RESTED | the one XP meter | Multiplies earned XP only, never hands out unlocks. |
| GEAR-3 — Market + extraction | 🔨 `fd8b895` (extraction ⏳) | PROGRESSION §3, GEAR §Rollout | Market node, extraction schematics | **PROMPT MARKET node + post-Seal phase SHIPPED via DESCENT §I slice 3** (CURIO/REGENERATE/PATCH, per-seat wallets, AI/AUTO). Extraction schematics (CACHE/SERVER ROOM) still owed (slice 5). |
| GEAR-4 — raid personal loot + Seal tables | 🔒 | PROGRESSION §4 | per-seat seeded loot, Ledger pages | Crests/standing need accounts→later. VERSION rows need Trial Ladder. |
| Universal Curio Pool v2 (~18 curios) | 🟡 | GEAR §POOL-v2 | `gear_catalog.gd` | Approved-not-final. Cut 10 welded, keep 6, add 18 cross-spec. |
| CURIO ARMORY v3 — the big slate (~40 rows) | 🟡 | GEAR §ARMORY-v3 | `gear_catalog.gd` (+ per row: BACKUPS §9 · JAILBREAK §7 · BENCHMARK §I · foil/temp-slot micro-mechanics) | At Bill's narrowing verdict (target keep ~15–20). Adds the FEEL BAR (every row names its MOMENT). Additive to v2 pool; obeys v2 hard rules; no G/H actives. |
| Actives socket + paper active items | 🔒 | GEAR §Rollout | 1–2 sockets, G/H keys | Unlocks RELAY BATON/MUTE/ROLLBACK/UNPLUGGING etc. Some gated on Seal page (GEAR-4). |
| Escort/volatile tickets follow-up | ⏳ | WORLD §MEWGENICS ① | burden flavor, lane-law reward | Slice built (`ESCORT_PREVIEW`). Burden flavor needs interrupt pillar. |
| Armor set presentation panel | 💡 | PROGRESSION §ARMORY | `armor_doll.gd` paper-doll | Presentation only; reads existing draft state. |
| Unlock banking rule (win-only checkmark) | ⏳ | PROGRESSION §Drops | `rift_gear.cfg` persistence | First-kill checkmark banks on WIN; oaths bank win-or-lose. |
| E.5 oath drop-dedication | 🔒 | MASTER §SYSTEMS-E.5 | `beneficiary_seat_i` on oath state | Byte-identical self-default. Ties to Depth curation-capacity. |
| Raid wipe budget + floor checkpoint | 🔒 | WORLD §STAKES-MODEL | `RunState`/descent save-resume, `RunDirector`, raid loss-mode | Answers open-Q#6. Numbers→playtest. Needs descent-checkpoint plumbing. Dungeon stays 1-life. **Kept verbatim in DESCENT, re-fictioned BACKUPS (§9) — build with §I.** |
| Attempt tokens (Death-Defiance consumable) | 🔒 | WORLD §STAKES-MODEL | budget counter, Market (GEAR-3), TICKETS node reward, `draft.gd` | +1 attempt, any surface. Token sink — rides the PROMPT MARKET (§I) + the ticket turn-in fork (DESCENT §10). |
| Boon/curio battle-rez layer | 💡 | WORLD §STAKES-MODEL | `gear_catalog`, existing `revive` ClassKit hook | Healer Rekindle already BUILT; extend beyond healer so healer-less comps aren't hard-locked. |

### E. Depth & Teeth (`game/draft.gd` + map + Depth)

| Item | St | Specced | Touches | Blocks on / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rerolls-out + Tokens→Market | 🔨 `fd8b895` | TEETH §REROLLS | `draft.gd`, ASCENSION-STEAL | **SHIPPED via DESCENT §I slice 3b:** REGENERATE charges replace the token REROLL; LOCK retired; UPSELL kept; Hot Reload→+2 charges, Hashgrinder→market −1⏣. Market slot 3 buys charges. Earned-charge faucets (tickets/BENCHMARK) ride later slices. |
| CONTEST primitive (skill-check node) | 🔒→🟡 | TEETH §CONTEST | new node + scoring over `strike_judge.gd` | **Lands via DESCENT §I as BENCHMARK** (scoring rule = DESCENT V#5; co-op + contest modes). Reuses CAPTCHA + lockstep. |
| Loot two-modes (need/greed + AI banter-roll) | 🔒 | TEETH §LOOT | `raid_hud._after_drop` | Reuses rarity+pity roll. Solves AI-gear blocker (AI allies roll & banter). |
| Spells & depth reweight (pilot one class) | 🔒 | TEETH §SPELLS | `type:"spell"` draft weight | Open: which class pilots. NOT a tank spec until tank lands. Folds into next rework. |
| Curse cards (biting blessings) | 🔨 `a22c1ec`+`7e5397f` (welded-boons ⏳) | TEETH §CURSE | welded-downside boons + poisoned-ability flag | **SHIPPED via DESCENT §I slice 4 as THE JAILBREAK** (two-deal node + curse system: ECONOMY/HP/TIMING **+ the run-length DECK poisoned-ability tax, offline** `7e5397f`; cap 2, DEPRECATE/Cooling exits, no-run-long-timing HARD RULE). Owed: the welded-downside DRAFT boons (② door) + online DECK (spec-thread + protocol bump). |
| Event-crafting (elite→extract→keystone unlock) | 🔒 | TEETH §crafting | event shape, oath-gated unlock | Partially reverses crafting-cut; counter-grind stays cut. |
| Endless door — **THE BLIND DESCENT (fog-of-war maze crawler)** | 🟡 designed | **`ENDLESS-PLAN.md`** (design v1, 8-verdict board §V, 2026-07-11) | map layer (maze generator mode + fog state + map-screen fog render — ⚠ same hotspot as DESCENT §I, land AFTER) · `run_director`/`campaign_core` (floor chain) · Atlas node + endless standing page | Depth math untouched (rides `spec.depth` — MASTER §MODES owns; TEETH's don't-fork rule honored). Slices S0–S4, flagged `ENDLESS_PREVIEW`. Hunter = per-floor printed term · dead-ends-always-pay law · honest info economy (VANTAGE/CHARTS/SCOUT; lying-signposts CUT). ⚠ NOT AI-themed (Bill 2026-07-11; skin verdict §V-8). |

### F. Endgame & bosses (`raid_content` + `raid_sim` + `TuningConfig`)

| Item | St | Specced | Touches | Blocks on / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trial Ladder ("Versions") | 🔴 | MASTER §MODES | `TuningConfig` + strings, version dial on door | Author the mechanic-adds. Proves Depth's scaling hooks. Unlocks VERSION-row gear. |

out of EVENT quota) · V11 per-seat earned wallets. Numbers = tune-on-feel, not blockers.

**SLICE 1 = THE MAP BANG, shipped:** the one `raid_map_sim` re-baseline is DONE (walker +
`CampaignCore` moved together · descent invariants proven in-sim · per-fight ttk column · Prior
term dropped in the same bang · protocol v15 · solo `map_sim`/`raid_sim` byte-identical). The
new node kinds exist ON the map now with honest stub interiors — slices 3–5 flip
`RunMap.MARKET_LIVE / JAILBREAK_LIVE / MINIGAME_LIVE` without regenerating a single map.

### J. THE DUNGEON STRUCTURE (`DUNGEON-PLAN.md` — 🟡 the cluster at Bill's 8-verdict board §V, 2026-07-10)

⚠ **Sequencing:** land AFTER the §I one-bang re-baseline (the dungeon is a `run_map` PRESET on the
same inputs/invariants — piggyback its shape assert on that suite, no second baseline). Dungeon 1
content authoring (nodes + THE TALLYMAN) stays the W3 claim (§D row) — this cluster de-risks it
to content work. Adds **ZERO rows to the `draft.gd` claim queue** by design.

| Item | St | Specced | Touches | Blocks on / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dungeon map preset (7 rows/~17 nodes/1 Seal + quota bag + invariants) | 🟡 V#1 | DUNGEON §2–3 | `run_map` inputs preset, map-sim invariants, `RunDirector` run-shape | Rides §I's re-baseline bang. Farm-lap ~25 / push-lap ~29 min budget. |

| The skin table (~8 world-skin display strings) | 🟡 V#2 | DUNGEON §5 | one lookup fn over market/curse/skill-node/attempt strings | Realm doors keep DESCENT names; bound: ONE world column ever. |
| Subset table config (per-dungeon system toggles) | 🟡 V#5 | DUNGEON §9 | run-spec subset flags, door banner | Creed-only first (D1) · Module-not-Creed (D2, W5). Byte-identical where a system is off. |
| Dungeon Seal contract (6–7 min named boss) + QUEUE-lite board | 🟡 V#6/#8 | DUNGEON §4/§8 | (the boss pass) · ticket board reuse | Contract only — THE TALLYMAN kit + Versions ladder = W3/boss-pass work. DEED-weighted ticket mix. |

## 3. AWAITING BILL'S VERDICT (decide before building)

The 🟡 pull-list — open decisions that will rot the plan if left. Grouped:

- ~~**THE DESCENT REBUILD**~~ — **✅ ALL 12 DECIDED (Bill, 07-10), cluster flipped 🔒 (§I).**
  Notables: NO 2nd module (V7) · STANDING/Prior deleted entirely (V8) · WILD ~10% (V9) ·
  per-seat wallets (V11). Also closes the old Teeth feel-verdicts for CONTEST scoring
  (best-of-N) + curse magnitudes (mixed menu, lean gentle) below.
- **THE SETTING (THEME-PLAN §6)** — 7 dials: origin (made-wonders recommended) · why-now ·
  rarity tier names · module rename · title · org · mystery volume. Unblocks the naming
  pass (§D row); riff-stage, keep riffing before ruling.
- **Tank·Duelist deck v1** — the whole slate is at your board (KEEP/TWEAK/CUT per card).
- **Warden deck** — later pass, but confirm the frame after Duelist.
- **Alchemist·Brew review** — 11 proposals (§8).
- **Alchemist open calls** — F1 (Opening interaction) · F2 (active-vs-idle patience) · F3 (auto-evasion identity — gates Cask under-fire) · F20 (grow VIAL non-minigame).
- **Well** — Glint 3-tier ladder vs built 2-tier.
- **Twinfang** — "On the Beat" card.
- **Curio Pool v2** — approved-but-not-final (~18 curios).
- **CURIO ARMORY v3** — the ~40-row big slate at GEAR-CATALOG §ARMORY-v3 (keep ~15–20; 5 rows carry ⚠ flags needing a ruling).
- **Teeth feel-verdicts** — ~~CONTEST scoring · curse magnitudes~~ (✅ closed by DESCENT V#5/V#4) · still open: spells-reweight pilot class · Endless framing (Depth coordination).
- **Deck-reshape (per class)** — CD shape · 2-vs-3 branches · keystone generic-vs-category · map reward-legibility mix · curse-card × EASE interplay.
- ~~**Interrupt-by-ability** — which Tempo ability carries the kick.~~ ✅ **Eviscerate** (Twinfang) + the Duelist combo dump; press-anytime (no tight window) — BUILT & MERGED `3126437` 2026-07-12.
- **REFIT Phase 4** — the P4 claim table is at your verdict (§CODE AUDIT).

*Playtest-tune (build then dial, not blockers): FLOW-economy numbers · Duelist minigame numbers · all reworked-class balance bands.*

## 4. HOW TO MAINTAIN THIS DOC

1. **Design locks** → add/flip the row here in the **same commit** as the plan-doc change (mirror CARD-CATALOG's law).
2. **Code merges** → flip `St` to 🔨 + short SHA; when fully shipped, strike the row or move it to a "Shipped" tail (keep it lean).
3. **Never write design here** — if you're tempted, write it in the plan doc and link. This is an index.
4. **Re-run the audit** (the 5-scout sweep that built this) after a big planning burst to catch new scatter and doc-drift.
5. **§0 collision map is the point** — when you claim a file in the hotspot table, check who else is queued on it and serialize.
